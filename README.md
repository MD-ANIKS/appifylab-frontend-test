# Frontend Design Test - Appifylab

This repository contains the partial implementation of the Figma design provided by **Appifylab** for the Frontend Design Test. Unfortunately, due to electricity issues, only 30% of the site was completed within the 3-hour time frame. This project showcases my ability to implement a pixel-perfect design using React, Tailwind CSS, and HTML.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a pixel-perfect website based on the provided Figma design. Due to time constraints, I managed to complete only a portion of the site, but it demonstrates the following:

- **React**: Component-based architecture for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Responsiveness**: Partially responsive design with mobile-friendly elements.
- **Attention to Detail**: Focus on matching the provided Figma design as closely as possible.

## Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend-design-appifylab
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit:

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React file structure:

```plaintext
src/
│
├── components/        # Reusable components for the UI
├── assets/            # Images, fonts, and other static assets
├── styles/            # Global styles and tailwind configuration
├── App.jsx            # Main application file
├── index.css          # Global styles
└── index.js           # Entry point for the app

## Features Implemented

- **Header**: Contains the navigation links and the logo.
- **Footer**: Displays contact information and links to important pages.
- **Home Page**: The main landing page with some of the design elements in place.

## Known Issues

- The project is incomplete due to the time limitation and electricity issues. Only about 30% of the site was developed.
- The Figma design was removed after the submission window, so further implementation could not be continued.

## Future Improvements

- **Complete the design**: Implement the remaining sections of the Figma design.
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Ensure that the entire website is fully responsive across devices.
- **Enhanced interactivity**: Add more dynamic elements and animations for a smoother user experience.
